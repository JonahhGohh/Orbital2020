The younger you start, the better. Yesterday is gone, but today you can make a choice to pick up this skill. But, don't wait until tomorrow.\r\n\r\nYou come first, not sales targets.\r\nThe Monetary Authority of Singapore conducted a mystery shopping in 2011 and found that 30% of the products were clearly unsuitable. It is likely that one of every three policies you have purchased from your financial advisor is unsuitable for your situation. This is a result of having (some) advisors who prioritise sales target over the needs of their clients. We are fellow clients, so we understand. We will seek out what really works best for you because we do unto you as we want done unto us.\r\n\r\nYou don't need 'professional' or 'academic' training to be good in investing.\r\nYour investments will do well by following well-grounded, results-oriented principles. In fact, you have some advantages that a professional wouldn't have. You'd only need to understand what these advantages are to exploit them. You are investing your money, not passing exams to get a job in finance. There is a big difference.\r\n\r\nYou don't need hype.\r\nThere isn't a lack of events which make audacious claims to make you a multi-millionaire.
